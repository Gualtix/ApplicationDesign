# Java Collections
```
Java Collections is a Framework that contains a group of classes and interfaces that provides
a "Collection" of standarized data structures whit the main characteristic
that all of them implements a set of common methods and rules. Java Collection
as Framework was first introduced in the JDK 1.2.

Before this concept, collectionswhere a few data structures clases. 
Mainly, were via the array, the Vector, and the Hashtable classes, 
which unfortunately were not easy to extend, and did not implement a 
standard member interface.

Now a days, the Java Collections Framework provides high-performance 
data structures that are easy to use and extend. About this topic,
developers can use the concept of Parameterized Types (or Generics)
to define the type of the elements of the collection.

<b>On the importance of sentence length</b></p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>
This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together bocome monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It's like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety.<br><br>
    Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasent rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals -- sounds that say listen to this, it is important.

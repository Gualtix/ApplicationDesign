# Java Collections
```
Java Collections is a Framework that contains a group of classes and interfaces that provides
a "Collection" of standarized data structures whit the main characteristic
that all of them implements a set of common methods and rules. Java Collection
as Framework was first introduced in the JDK 1.2.

Before this concept, collectionswhere a few data structures clases. 
Mainly, were via the array, the Vector, and the Hashtable classes, 
which unfortunately were not easy to extend, and did not implement a 
standard member interface.

Now a days, the Java Collections Framework provides high-performance 
data structures that are easy to use and extend. About this topic,
developers can use the concept of Parameterized Types (or Generics)
to define the type of the elements of the collection.
